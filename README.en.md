This server is a 1.20.1 modded survival server, featuring mods such as Touhou Little Maid, Farmer's Delight series, Ars Nouveau, Refined Storage, Twilight Forest, etc. To ensure the gaming experience for all Pioneers, the following exclusive rules are established. Violations will be punished based on severity with warnings, bans, data clearance, etc.

I. Basic Code of Conduct

1. Strictly prohibit the use of cheat clients, hacks, or mods, including but not limited to flying, X-ray, item duplication, instant-kill, and other cheating behaviors; exploiting mod bugs (e.g., duplicating items via maid tasks, duplicating resources using storage mods) for unfair gain is forbidden. Discovered bugs must be reported to admins promptly.
2. Prohibit posting advertisements, politically sensitive, pornographic, violent, or other inappropriate content; personal attacks, insults, and spreading rumors are not allowed; spamming and maliciously @mentioning all players in the server chat are prohibited. Keep the chat channels clean.
3. Respect the work of other Pioneers. Malicious destruction of others' structures, farms, Redstone contraptions, maid robots, storage systems, etc., is forbidden; moving modded items placed by others (e.g., Maid Cores, Storage Disks, Magic Glyphs) without permission is not allowed.
4. Prohibit building high-frequency Redstone circuits or lag-inducing machines (e.g., infinitely looping maid task machines, extremely large storage networks). If a contraption causes significant server TPS drop, admins have the right to demand its removal and restrict the use of related mod functions.

II. Mod-Specific Gameplay Rules

(A) Related to Touhou Little Maid Mod

1. Set maid tasks reasonably. Exploiting the task mechanics of mods like maid_useful_task / maid_storage_manager to duplicate items or experience, or having maids perform infinitely repetitive, lag-causing tasks is prohibited.
2. Maliciously attacking or killing other players' maid robots is forbidden. If you need to use another player's maid, you must obtain the owner's permission in advance; Stealing maid equipment or core components is prohibited.
3. The spawning and management of maids must comply with server entity limits. No more than 10 maids are allowed per chunk to avoid server lag caused by excessive entities.

(B) Related to Agriculture/Food Mods (Farmer's Delight, Aquaculture, etc.)

1. Farmland cultivation and aquaculture should be reasonable. Prohibit building excessively large, uncontrolled farms/fisheries in public areas (e.g., spawn points, dimension entrances) that monopolize public resources.
2. Ingredient and food trading must be conducted in good faith. Prohibit using mods like CraftTweaker to modify recipes for fraudulent transactions with other players, or maliciously interfering with others' gameplay using mechanics from mods like diet.
3. Prohibit placing contaminating items from mods in water source areas, damaging the aquaculture and marine environment (e.g., OceansDelight).

(C) Related to Magic Mods (Ars Nouveau)

1. Magic glyphs and spellcasting must be used compliantly. Prohibit casting large-scale destructive spells (e.g., area instant-kill, terrain destruction) to attack other players or damage public terrain.
2. Trading or gifting magic items (e.g., Spellbooks, Source Gems) must be voluntary. Prohibit seizing or scamming others' rare magic items; Exploiting magic bugs to infinitely generate Source or Glyphs is forbidden.

(D) Related to Storage/Industrial Mods (Refined Storage, Industrial Upgrade, etc.)

1. When using Refined Storage, building cross-dimensional item duplication devices or exploiting storage node bugs to duplicate disks or materials is prohibited; ExtraDisks expansion disks must be used appropriately, prohibiting the abuse of storage permissions.
2. Generators and reactors from industrial mods must be placed with reasonable planning. Prohibit building unprotected high-risk installations (e.g., nuclear reactors) near Pioneer bases to avoid explosions damaging terrain and structures.

(E) Related to Dimension Exploration Mods (Twilight Forest, The Undergarden, etc.)

1. Boss fights in Twilight Forest or The Undergarden and collection of rare resources must be fair. Prohibit using mod items to maliciously block bosses, kill them instantly, or monopolize key resource points like diamond veins or Twilight Forest castles.
2. Prohibit building structures that block passage at dimension entrances, or exploiting dimension teleportation mechanics to maliciously teleport other players to dangerous areas like The Undergarden abyss or Twilight Forest Lich towers.

III. Land and Interaction Rules

1. The server has land protection mods enabled. Pioneers can use mod commands to claim exclusive land or place signs to mark ownership of structures and mod facilities; If someone maliciously occupies or destroys facilities like maids, storage, or farms within your land, you can submit a complaint to an admin. Penalties will be applied to violators after verification.
2. When trading mod items or resources with other Pioneers, uphold principles of good faith. Prohibit fraud, price gouging of rare items like magic glyphs or maid cores, or trading with fake items; If trade disputes arise, you can request admin mediation. Admins will judge based on the actual situation.
3. Entering others' non-public structures, bases, or lands, or inspecting their storage systems or maid task configurations without the owner's explicit permission is prohibited. If entry/inspection is needed, obtain permission in advance via in-game chat or the server community. Unauthorized entry is considered harassment.
4. When teaming up for dimension exploration or boss fights, abide by team agreements on loot distribution. Prohibit privately taking rare mod items like Twilight Forest Knightly Swords or Ars Nouveau epic spellbooks for oneself.

IV. Penalty Mechanism

1. First Offense: Verbal warning from an admin, requiring rectification of the violation (e.g., dismantling lag machines, returning stolen mod items, restoring damaged structures).
2. Second Offense: Temporary account ban for 1-7 days, clearing illegally obtained mod items/resources; If involving malicious destruction, compensation for the victim's loss is required.
3. Severe Violation: Behaviors like repeated cheating, exploiting mod bugs to disrupt the server, or maliciously attacking other players will result in permanent account ban, clearance of related game data, and appeals are not accepted.
4. Special Circumstances: Unintentional violations caused by mod bugs may lead to reduced or waived penalties if the player proactively explains the situation to an admin and cooperates with fixes.

V. Other Notes

1. Server admins hold the right to interpret these rules and determine violations. If you object to a penalty, you can submit a written appeal to an admin (with evidence like in-game screenshots or videos).
2. The server performs regular data backups but is not responsible for losses caused by players' own operations (e.g., accidentally deleting a maid, formatting a storage disk). It is recommended to personally backup important mod items.
3. Pioneers are welcome to provide reasonable suggestions to admins for optimizing mod gameplay and improving server functions, working together to enhance the server's gaming environment.
